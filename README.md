# House_price_Predictions
This project predicts house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, space, lot size, tax, and more. It uses regression techniques, including Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting, to achieve accurate predictions. The Gradient Boosting model outperformed the baseline model with an RÂ² score of 0.865 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 22.76

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights from EDA:

Correlation between features and target (Price).
Distribution plots for each feature.
Boxplots to detect and remove outliers.
Heatmaps for feature relationships.
ðŸ¤– Model Performance
Model	MSE	RÂ² Score
Linear Regression	67.61	0.5996
Gradient Boosting	22.76	0.8652
Gradient Boosting showed superior performance with better accuracy and lower error rates.

Making Predictions
After training the model, predict house prices using custom input:

python
Copy
Edit
from joblib import load
import numpy as np

# Load saved model
model = load('models/gradient_boosting_model.pkl')

# Example input: [Bedroom, Space, Room, Lot, Tax, Bathroom, Garage, Condition]
input_features = np.array([[3, 1100, 7, 50, 1099, 1.5, 1, 0]])
predicted_price = model.predict(input_features)

print(f"Predicted House Price: {predicted_price[0]:.2f}")
How to Run the Project

Future Work
Incorporate more advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.
Add a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
Perform hyperparameter tuning for further accuracy improvements.
